# Introduction | Fuzzy Logic

The term fuzzy refers to things which are not clear or are vague. In the real world many times we encounter a situation when we canâ€™t determine whether the state is true or false, their fuzzy logic provides a very valuable flexibility for reasoning. In this way, we can consider the inaccuracies and uncertainties of any situation.

In boolean system truth value, 1.0 represents absolute truth value and 0.0 represents absolute false value. But in the fuzzy system, there is no logic for absolute truth and absolute false value. But in fuzzy logic, there is intermediate value too present which is partially true and partially false.
